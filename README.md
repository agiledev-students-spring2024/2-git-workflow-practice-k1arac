# Jeffrey's Opinion

As a DAW user myself, I found this article to be very interesting and intriguing. One thing about it that I agree with is the versatility of software developers in many industries and their importance. DAWS, virtual instruments, mixing and mastering software, plugins, etc. have all been developed by software engineers. Their knowledge would be extensive to create software but also understanding how audio works and making it compatible with many devices.
